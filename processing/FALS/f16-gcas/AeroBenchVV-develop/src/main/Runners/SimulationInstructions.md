# Simulation Instructions

1. Navigate to the AeroBench directory
1. Open `AeroBench/F16_Sim/Runners/main.m` 
1. Run `main.m`
1. Do NOT change directories. Instead, add the file to your MATLAB Path
    - (This effectively adds `AeroBench/F16_Sim/Runners` to path, which you can do manually instead if preferred)
1. View your results in `AeroBench/Results`
    - You can modify the outputs generated at the bottom of `main.md`.
