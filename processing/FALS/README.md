Models for the ARCH competition (falsification)
===============================================

For licenses and contributors, see respective subfolders.

Each benchmark model comes with several files
- init_<model>.m    sets up the context to run the model
- run_<model>.m     contains a function that runs the model
                    with specified initial condition and time-varying input
- test_<model>.m    an example how to run it with concrete values
- requirements.txt  a text file documenting the model,
                    including notes on input parameterization
                    and temporal logic requirements
